         <p class="paragraph">It was back in June 2019, I was traveling to the Dominican Republic to visit my family and friends. She was a cashier at a Chinese restaurant at the airport and I was buying some food, whenI saw her I knew she was the love of my life. So I decided go ahead and talk to her , she did not want to at first but I decided to improvise and made a joke, she started to laugh and after 5 minutes talking she gave me her phone number.</p>

         <p class="paragraph">When she gave me her number I asked, what name should I put ? and She said Heidy, What is yours? and I said , I go by Francisco. I sent her a text the same night and she answered the next day and after three days she gave me a chance and ew went to the beach. We spend the day there and we had a really good time talking, eating and enjoy the nice breeze.</p>
